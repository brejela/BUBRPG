# BUBRPG
## Brejela's Ultra Basic RPG (BUBRPG)
BUBRPG is a RPG engine, essentially a RPG library.
For now it supports a player party with more than one character, dinamically sized inventory,
wearable and consumable items, with dinamic player attributes based on the items added
or removed.
Many new features are to be implemented, and a pygame frontend for ~~decent~~ gameplay.
